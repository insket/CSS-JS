  <h2>
    In winter, it is covered with snow and snow. When you climb to Jinding, you can see far and wide, and the
    scenery is very magnificent; West overlooking Aiai snow peak, Gongga Mountain and Wawu mountain, the mountains
    connect the sky; Looking south at the top of Ten Thousand Buddhas, the clouds are rolling and the momentum is
    magnificent; A panoramic view of the Pingchuan River in the north is as beautiful as a shop, with a panoramic
    view of the Dadu River and Qingyi River
